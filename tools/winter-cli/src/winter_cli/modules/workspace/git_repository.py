    """Service-level seam for the imperative git operations that init/destroy/prune perform.

    Distinct from `IReadRepoRepository` / `IWriteRepoRepository` (which model
    *winter's domain*: feature worktrees, syncing, etc.) — this Protocol
    exposes raw git verbs the lifecycle services need. The split keeps each
    surface focused: domain repositories speak in `FeatureWorktree` /
    `StandaloneRepository`, this one speaks in paths.

    Every method raises `RepoError` on git failure — GitPython types are
    confined to the adapter under `internal/`.

    Every method except `list_worktrees` takes a required keyword `repo_name`: the
    name of the repo the path belongs to, from the repo object the caller holds.
    Every path-taking method except `clone` and `list_worktrees` also takes a
    required keyword `env`: the name of the feature environment the call acts in,
    or `None` when the path is not a feature worktree (a source checkout, a
    standalone). Both label the call's trace span and change nothing else; the env
    is never derived from the path. `list_worktrees` is env discovery and opens no
    span.
